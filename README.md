# model-comparison-and-linear-regression-analysis
* Jan 4 Update: The grade is finally published so now I upload this piece of work onto GitHub.

This work was completed as part of the assessment for STAT0006 Regression Modelling, an undergraduate course offered by Department of Statistics at UCL. The project involves the application of simple and multiple linear regression models to simulated data, with a focus on model comparison, residual diagnostics, and predictive performance evaluation.

This report is assembled and restructured from individual assignments, which reflects core components of scientific computing: reproducible analysis, quantitative model selection, and statistical reasoning. The entire workflow was carried out using R and R Markdown, ensuring transparency and clarity in data processing and model evaluation.

The tasks include:
1. Fitting simple and multiple linear regression models
2. Assessing goodness-of-fit using residual analysis
3. Comparing models via adjusted R squared and ANOVA
4. Identifying potential issues such as multicollinearity and nonlinearity
   
The final grade for this work is A+. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of:
1. How to implement and interpret linear regression models in R
2. The practical considerations involved in model selection and evaluation 3. The importance of graphical diagnostics in validating assumptions
4. Communicating statistical results clearly through code and commentary
